Mar. 2022 – Nov. 2022 (10 months)
Data Scientist
Autonomous City of Buenos Aires, Buenos Aires, Argentina
• Improving evaluation metrics efficiency and accuracy for an attribution
model converting a costly O(nen ) metric
calculation to a O(n) metric.
• Streamlined ETL analysis, support, documentation, automation, and
configuration file design by merging the ETLs of
two clients into a single system, reducing the team size and support time
required by 50%.
• Reproduced the clients’ production dashboard locally with Matplotlib,
cutting QA times by half.
• Tech: Bash, DataBricks, StreamSets, BigQuery, Dataproc, PySpark,
Azure, Python, in-house models & BI tools.

• Ground-up implementation of agent-based demographic simulation with
300k+ agents. The data pipeline includes:
Automatic config & log files, post-execution analysis, testing &
benchmarking. Use of computer clusters.
• Mathematical modeling courses: dynamical systems, stochastic models,
game theory, technology & healthcare models.
• AI: Machine Learning, Deep Learning, LSTM, NLP, image processing,
encoding, feature engineering & clustering.
• Data handling: ETL, data mining from multiple runs of simulation data
with Bash and Python scripts.
• Software development: Data Science with Python. Computational models
in physics, biology & healthcare projects.
CUDA oriented to simulations. Basic data structures in C; trees, stacks,
lists.
• Simulated the course correction and orientation control system in a
modeled satellite using a Kalman filter.
• Courses on Medical imaging: OpenCV, ImageJ, Matlab, and Python focusing
on computational tomographies.
• Biweekly instances of public speaking showing experimental results
and technical knowledge acquired.
